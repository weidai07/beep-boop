# _Beep-Boop_

#### _By Wei Dai_

## Description

This webpage is a finalized product of my week three project. It demonstrates the proficient use of loops and arrays.

## Setup

To use this portfolio, download the link from github at https://github.com/weidai07/beep-boop.git, open the index.html file in your web browser and proceed with the following instructions.

* _Enter a number in the box_

* _Click "Submit!" and view the results_

### Specification

This website will take the integer the user inputs, starting from 0, and convert it into a string. Next, the program will take the integer the user inputs and check specifically for the integers 1, 2, and 3. If a 1 is identified, the program will convert the integer 1 into 'Beep!'. If a 2 is identified, the program will convert the integer 2 into 'Boop!'. If a 3 is identified, the program will convert the integer 3 into 'I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that!'.

| Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- |
| 1 | "Beep!" |
| 2 | "Boop!" |
| 3 | "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that!" |
